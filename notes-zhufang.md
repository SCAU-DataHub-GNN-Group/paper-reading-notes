**Tasks**: Traffic prediction.

**Challenges**:

- Multi-resolution case and the factor of geographical contextual information.

**Drawback of existed methods** :

- In the multi-resolution perspective, these methods only consider the short term and smooth dynamics rather than the high dimensional time horizon. In the aspect of geographical contextual information, these methods don't get use of the information at the global level and the relations across the regions.

**Contributions** :

- Solution of multi-resolution: using attention mechanism to construct an multi-temporal level model. 
- Solution of geographical region: using GAT and graph-diffusion mechanism to construct an architecture.
- Aggregate them.

**Datasets**:

â€‹	BJ-Taxi, NYC-Taxi, NYC-Bike-1, NYC-Bike-2.

**Tasks**: Traffic prediction

**Challenges**

- Information of the given spatial matrix is not sufficient for model learning.

**Drawbacks of existed methods**:

- Ignore the temporal similarity between nodes then modeling the adjacency matrix.
- Ineffective to capture dependencies between local and global correlations.

**Contributions**

- Using fast-DTW algorithm to computer the similarity between two sequences of time-series data w.r.t two different nodes, and construct the temporal matrix $A_{TG}$.
- Aggregate $A_{TG}, A_{TC}, A_{SG}$ to construct the $A_{STFG}$ matrix.
- Construct the STFGN module with GLU function, residual connection-like operation.

- Add the output of STFGN module with Gated CNN module to capture the long-range spatial-temporal dependencies.
