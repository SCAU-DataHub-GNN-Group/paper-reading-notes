**Tasks** 
- Traffic Flow Forecasting.

**Challenges**  
- The graph spatial information includes not only the adjacency of local space, but also the global geographical background (cross regional dependency)
- More complex multi-resolution dependencies (hours, days, weeks)

**Drawback of existed methods** 
- They are only effective for short-term and smooth dynamics, and they are difficult to predict in high-order multi-dimensional time range.
- They only focus on the geographical correlation nearby, while ignoring the cross regional interdependence in the global context.

**Proposed model** 
- The author proposed a hierarchical graph neural network model with multi-scale self attention network and attention graph diffusion paradigm.

**Solution** 
- Solution of multi-resolution: using a multi-scale self-attention network to encode dynamic granularity with different time resolutions and add an aggregation layer.
- Solution of geographical region: using a hierarchical graph neural network combining graph attention network and graph convolution based diffusion mechanism.

**Question**
- Can the method of adaptive learning adjacency matrix be applied to the model in this paper?

**Tasks** 
- Traffic Flow Forecasting.

**Challenges**  
- Complex spatio-temporal correlation between different roads.
- The correlation representation of incomplete adjacent connections of graphs may limit the spatio-temporal dependent learning of these models.

**Drawback of existed methods** 
- Lack of an informative graph construction.
- The modeling of adjacency matrix ignores the time correlation of nodes
- Overfitting of spatial-temporal dependencies learning.
.
**Proposed model** 
- Based on dynamic time warping, the author proposes an s'j algorithm including time fusion graph module and gated expansion convolution.

**Solution** 
- Solution of informative graph construction: Based on DTW,generate Spatial Graph, Temporal Graph and Temporal Connectivity graph and combine them to form Spatial-Temporal Fusion Graph.
- Solution of capturing local and global dependencies: using a Gated dilated CNN module with spatial-temporal fusion graph module in parallel.
