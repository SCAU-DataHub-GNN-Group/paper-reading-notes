# Distribution platform of papers and everyone's notes 

&copy; Created by SCAU DataHub GNN Group.

## Policy

> 1. Two or three papers per day, and paper links of them will be released in this README file.
> 2. Everyone of you should upload your notes before the next two papers realease.
> 3. Paper notes should be written in English and organized in your own words. *DO NOT COPY THE ABSTRACT PART OF THE PAPER.*
> 4. In addition to the required two papers every day, you also can upload you own paper notes w.r.t any other interesting papers you like.
> 5. Everyone of you should maintain your own paper notes in **One Single Markdown File.**

## Reading Advices:

It's not proper to read the paper concisely at the first time, you should have a sketch reading before you decide to have a careful and thorough reading. Here are some advices:

> 1. What is the problem we need to solve(research motivation)?
> 2. Why this problem is important?
> 3. What is the challenge point of the problem(problems)?
> 4. Are there anyone had a try at the problem? What are their solutions?
> 5. Why didn't the old solution work well?
> 6. What is the paper's solution of the challenge?
> 7. What are the contributions of this paper?
> 8. What is the key idea of this paper?
> 9. Check the correctness of these theorems(if exists).
